## Instructions
Hello there! I'm psyched to introduce you to this amazing app of mine!! :satisfied: In this game, you click on a tile to reveal its content and then try to find the matching tile (another tile that has the same content). When you find the matching tile, you will know :smile: It's pretty straightforward. It's a game of concentration, the quicker you find a matching tile, (in the barest minimum number of moves) the higher your star rating (the rating begins with 5 stars).

**Play away and enjoy!! :smiley: :smile:**

## Implementation
The starter file for this app was provided by Udacity contatining HTML, CSS and a dummy JavaScript file. I built on it, customized it to be this app that you're viewing now. Interesting, right? :wink:

## Responsiveness
This app is responsive on all viewports ranging from small screens, (phones) medium screens, (phablets and tablets) large and extra-large screens (laptops). Don't take my word for it though, you can check to be sure. :smile:

## Dependencies
The game largely depends on [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) because without these icons, you cannot view the content in each tile. Special appreciation to Font Awesome Library.
