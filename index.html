		<p> This is a game where you need to match pairs of tiles. Playing is very simple - you turn over one tile and then try to find a matching tile. When you click on the first tile of a turn and you have exposed a matching tile in a previous turn, a message tells you that the pair is known. This indicates that you should then be able to make a match (if you have perfect recall). The scoring system incorporates this principle. 
        </p>

            <h3> Scoring </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> The timer starts when you open a pair of cards (matched or unmatched). </li>
                <li> Each time you make a successful match you score points. </li>
                <li>If you fail to match when you should have been able to (a matching tile was previously shown), you score (-2 * number of times match tile has been shown). So if a matching tile has been revealed three times before, you will score -6. </li>
                <li> If you have perfect recall, you score a bonus point.</li>
